# README

Private-Events

This project is loosely based on the idea of Eventbrite and is a part of the course material
at https://theodinproject.com

The idea is to set up the data structure of an event planning site using Ruby on Rails.
Users can create and attend events. Events have a date and location and many users.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
