Private-Events

This project is loosely based on the idea of Eventbrite and is a part of the course material
at https://theodinproject.com

The idea is to set up the data structure of an event planning site using Ruby on Rails.
Users can create and attend events. Events have a date and location and many users.

After completion, I am typically not happy with the spaghetti state of my code.
I may come back to this project and re-arrange ERB files into partials and add
some styling.

All in all, I learned a lot about Rails Associations, Scopes vs Class Methods, passing
parameters and picked up a few new ways to query a database with filter methods such as
where and find_by.

On to the next!
